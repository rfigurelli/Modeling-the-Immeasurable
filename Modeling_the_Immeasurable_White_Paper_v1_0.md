## Modeling the Immeasurable: A Scientific Method for Unpacking Abstract Human Concepts

**White Paper v1.2.2**
**Author:** Rogério Figurelli
**Date:** May 12, 2025

## Executive Summary

Abstract human concepts—such as wisdom, love, justice, and consciousness—shape cultural norms, inform personal choices, and underpin ethical frameworks. Yet their semantic richness and inherent ambiguity, labeled “suitcase words” by Marvin Minsky \[1], have defied precise measurement and reproducible modeling. This white paper introduces a systematic methodology to transform intangible concepts into structured, data-driven models that are scientifically rigorous and ethically grounded.

Our approach unfolds through five integrated phases: (1) Define an intuitive equation hypothesis; (2) Decompose each variable into bipolar dimensions; (3) Collect or simulate labeled data; (4) Optimize model weights via predictive training; and (5) Compare candidate equations under a performance–parsimony metric and iterate toward refinement.

**Illustrative Case Study:** We apply this framework to “wisdom” in a personal finance context—deciding how to allocate one’s monthly salary $S$. We designed 30 bipolar questions spanning Intelligence (I) and Consciousness (C), with subsets: Memory, Reasoning, Creativity; Judgment, Empathy, Responsibility. Responses from three profiles (CFP expert E1, Behavioral Economist E2, End User E3) produced ten candidate equations evaluated on computed $I$ and $C$ scores. The exponential model:

$$
W = I^C
$$

emerged as the clear winner: maximizing discrimination between profiles, minimizing complexity, and offering high interpretability.

Beyond this exemplar, our framework generalizes to any abstract concept, leveraging real experts or specialized LLMs for labeling. The result is a transparent, adaptable, and ethically informed blueprint for embedding nuanced human values into AI systems.

## 1 Introduction

Natural language abounds with abstract nouns—justice, compassion, wisdom—words that guide social norms and personal aspirations but evade consistent definition. Their ambiguity complicates attempts to encode them in algorithmic systems, which require precise, reproducible logic.

Marvin Minsky labeled such terms “suitcase words” \[1] because they pack multiple meanings into a single label. While effective for human communication, suitcase words hinder scientific modeling and AI, leading to opaque or unpredictable behaviors.

This paper presents a method for unpacking these concepts: starting from a high-level equation, decomposing into bipolar dimensions, translating qualitative insights into quantitative measures, and iterating through data-driven refinement.

## 2 Problem Statement

Despite advances in psychometrics and ontology engineering, there is no unified methodology that balances empirical accuracy with conceptual clarity when modeling abstract human constructs. Existing methods are either too simplistic—failing to capture nuance—or overly complex—hindering interpretability and risking overfitting. A scalable, flexible framework with iterative feedback loops is required.

## 3 Proposed Framework

The methodology comprises five phases:

1. **Define an Intuitive Equation:** Formulate a high-level hypothesis (e.g., $W = I^C$).
2. **Decompose Variables:** Break each term into at least ten bipolar dimensions (e.g., Short-term–Long-term, Logical–Intuitive) on a 1–10 scale.
3. **Collect or Simulate Data:** Gather labeled cases via expert annotation or synthetic generation.
4. **Optimize Weights:** Train using machine learning to minimize mean squared error on outcome labels.
5. **Compare & Iterate:** Score candidates by $S = R^2 - \lambda C$ (predictive power minus complexity penalty) and retain top models for subsequent rounds.

## 4 Core Principles

1. **Intuition-to-Data Loop:** Hypotheses generated by experts or LLMs are validated against real data.
2. **Bipolar Dimensionality:** Opposing scales capture semantic richness quantitatively.
3. **Performance–Parsimony Trade-off:** Balances predictive accuracy with model simplicity.
4. **Human–Machine Collaboration:** Experts refine dimensions while LLMs generate candidate formulations.

## 5 Case Study: Wisdom in Salary Allocation

We illustrate the framework on: “What is the wisest use of your monthly salary $S$?”.

### 5.1 Bipolar Question Design

Participants rate each pair on a 1–10 scale to reflect their decision style when allocating $S$. Dimensions:

**Intelligence (I)**

* **Memory (M):** Short-term–Long-term; Volatile–Stable; Forgotten–Retained; Disorganized–Organized; Decontextualized–Contextual.
* **Reasoning (Rsn):** Deductive–Inductive; Logical–Intuitive; Linear–Associative; Systematic–Ad hoc; Abstract–Concrete.
* **Creativity (Cr):** Conservative–Innovative; Traditional–Pioneering; Reproductive–Original; Restrictive–Expansive; Monothematic–Polymath.

**Consciousness (C)**

* **Judgment (J):** Precipitate–Prudent; Unjust–Just; Simplistic–Nuanced; Biased–Impartial; Vindictive–Understanding.
* **Empathy (E):** Cold–Sensitive; Indifferent–Understanding; Sarcastic–Supportive; Self-centered–Attentive; Rational–Affective.
* **Responsibility (R):** Irresponsible–Ethical; Inattentive–Careful; Negligent–Committed; Passive–Engaged; Arbitrary–Conscious.

### 5.2 Simulated Expert Data

Three profiles provided ratings across the 30 questions. Subscore averages:

| Profile                   | $I$  | $C$  |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| E1 – CFP Expert           | 6.68 | 6.94 |
| E2 – Behavioral Economist | 6.51 | 6.66 |
| E3 – End User             | 5.41 | 5.45 |

### 5.3 Equation Evaluation

We evaluated ten candidate equations:

| Equation | Formula                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| W₁       | $I^C$                         |
| W₂       | $I \times C$                  |
| W₃       | $\log(I + C)$                 |
| W₄       | $(I \times C + M)/2$          |
| W₅       | $I^C \times Rsn$              |
| W₆       | $I^C + J$                     |
| W₇       | $(I \times C \times E)^{1/3}$ |
| W₈       | $I + C$                       |
| W₉       | $I^2/(C + 1)$                 |
| W₁₀      | $\min(I, C)$                  |

Computed values for E1/E2/E3:

| Eq. | E1        | E2        | E3        |
| --- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| W₁  | 529 600.8 | 262 089.4 | 9 906.6   |
| W₂  | 46.36     | 43.36     | 29.48     |
| W₃  | 2.61      | 2.58      | 2.39      |
| W₄  | 26.39     | 25.16     | 17.59     |
| W₅  | 3 876 678 | 1 635 438 | 50 919.98 |
| W₆  | 529 607.9 | 262 096.0 | 9 912.3   |
| W₇  | 6.76      | 6.63      | 5.46      |
| W₈  | 13.62     | 13.17     | 10.86     |
| W₉  | 5.62      | 5.53      | 4.54      |
| W₁₀ | 6.68      | 6.51      | 5.41      |

**Analysis:** W₁ ($I^C$) maximizes separation between profiles, requires only two inputs, and offers an interpretable exponential interaction of intelligence and consciousness. Other forms either underperform in discrimination or introduce complexity without sufficient benefit.

### 5.4 Case Study Conclusion

The salary-allocation scenario confirms that:

$$
W = I^C
$$

is the optimal balance of predictive accuracy, simplicity, and semantic clarity, validating our methodology and demonstrating its practical applicability.
