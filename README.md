## Executive Summary

Abstract human concepts—such as wisdom, love, justice, and consciousness—shape cultural norms, inform personal choices, and underpin ethical frameworks. Yet their semantic richness and inherent ambiguity, labeled “suitcase words” by Marvin Minsky \[1], have defied precise measurement and reproducible modeling. This white paper introduces a systematic methodology to transform intangible concepts into structured, data-driven models that are scientifically rigorous and ethically grounded.

Our approach unfolds through five integrated phases: (1) Define an intuitive equation hypothesis; (2) Decompose each variable into bipolar dimensions; (3) Collect or simulate labeled data; (4) Optimize model weights via predictive training; and (5) Compare candidate equations under a performance–parsimony metric and iterate toward refinement.

**Illustrative Case Study:** We apply this framework to “wisdom” in a personal finance context—deciding how to allocate one’s monthly salary $S$. We designed 30 bipolar questions spanning Intelligence (I) and Consciousness (C), with subsets: Memory, Reasoning, Creativity; Judgment, Empathy, Responsibility. Responses from three profiles (CFP expert E1, Behavioral Economist E2, End User E3) produced ten candidate equations evaluated on computed $I$ and $C$ scores. The exponential model:

$$
W = I^C
$$

emerged as the clear winner: maximizing discrimination between profiles, minimizing complexity, and offering high interpretability.

Beyond this exemplar, our framework generalizes to any abstract concept, leveraging real experts or specialized LLMs for labeling. The result is a transparent, adaptable, and ethically informed blueprint for embedding nuanced human values into AI systems.
